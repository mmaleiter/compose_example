### Coding Example using jetpack compose 

This is a basic android example that uses jetpack compose,
dagger-hilt, navigation and other libraries 
generally used in android apps. It has two screens.
On home screen you can search for images and mark 
items as favourite. If you click on an item 
you land on the detail screen. There you see a larger 
version of the image and some data of the json response.

To be able to load data you need to create an account 
on pixabay.com and register the apiKey in a file
next to the project root. See the todo in build.gradle of the 
app.
